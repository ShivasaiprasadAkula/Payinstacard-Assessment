# Express Authentication with MongoDB and JWT
This project is a basic authentication system built with Express, MongoDB, and JSON Web Tokens (JWT). 
It allows users to sign up, log in, and access protected routes. 
User data is stored in a MongoDB database, and JWTs are used to authenticate and authorize access to protected routes. 
The project provides a simple folder structure for clarity and maintainability.
